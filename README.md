## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using:
- 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with rich visualizations
- 🧠 Machine Learning classification models
- 📊 Advanced SQL techniques for tabular summarization
- 📈 An interactive Power BI dashboard powered with **DAX**

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
- Size: ~890 rows × 12 columns

---

## 🔬 Key Components

### 📊 1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Performed Personal Data Analysis (PDA) using:
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`
- Outlier detection, missing value treatment
- Correlation heatmaps, histograms, violin plots, etc.

> 💡 Visuals made with **Plotly** add interactivity to explore patterns by age, gender, class, etc.

---

### 🛢️ 2. SQL Analysis (Advanced Queries)
Used **PostgreSQL/MySQL** to dig deeper into dataset using:
- ✅ `CASE` statements
- ✅ `PIVOT` tables for categorical breakdowns
- ✅ `WINDOW` functions (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`)
- ✅ Subqueries and CTEs for advanced filtering

> 🧠 SQL provided great insight into categorical impacts (e.g., survival by port/class/gender)

---

### 📈 3. Power BI Dashboard (Advanced)
Created a dynamic dashboard using:
- Custom **DAX measures**
- KPI cards, Slicers, Heatmaps
- Drill-down visuals for class, gender, port

> 💼 Designed for **non-technical stakeholders** to interactively filter and understand survival patterns.

---

### 🤖 4. Machine Learning
Built predictive models using `Scikit-learn`:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost (optional)
- Cross-validation, accuracy, and ROC-AUC scoring

> 🚀 Best performing model achieved ~82% accuracy.
